    <h3>Too Late to Buy A Home? School Redistricting and the Timing and Extent of Capitalization

    </h3>
In the past fifty years, a voluminous literature estimating the value of schools through
      capitalization in home prices has emerged. Prior research has identified capitalization using a
      variety of approaches including discontinuities caused by boundaries. Here, we use changes in school
      boundaries and the opening of a new school in Fayette County (Lexington), Kentucky to identify this
      capitalization. Critical to properly estimating the effect of redistricting is to account for when
      information on redistricting is available. We treat the information about the effects of zoning as
      occurring in three stages: announcement of the intent to open the new high school and redistricting,
      approval of the specific redistricting plan (map), and implementation (opening of the new high school
      and actual changes in boundaries). We find significant changes in values for homes redistricted from
      lower-performing schools and we find that this capitalization occurs well before implementation of the
      redistricting. As we show, failure to account for capitalization occurring before implementation will
      attenuate and even change the sign of capitalization.
